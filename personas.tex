\section{Using personas to help design}
To assist in constructing a design it should be visualized, such that ideas can be clarified and evaluated through these visualizations. REF 53 DEB?
One way to perform such a visualization is through personas
Personas are profiles of the possible users of the system the designer is designing for.
They are an amalgamation of details about a person, such as name and background, as well as goals and aspirations the person might have. REF
Personas want to achieve certain aims and undertake certain activities through the use of the system being designed, and exist to remind designers that they do not design for themselves.
They are a method of allowing designers to think about the system from a different perspective.
Since the system will be used by different types of people, it is necessary to develop several personas, to accurately capture a wide variety of goals and aspirations.
\\\\
The following list defines the possible primary personas this system would be developed for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parent looking for a tutoring service for their child
    \item Tutor looking to make their services available on the site (young, old?)
    \item Students of varying age that want to learn something new through personal tutoring
    \item din mor

\textbf{Storm}
Storm is 13 years old.
He is a quiet boy, who gets bullied at school.

He finds solace in playing video games, especially one particular game. 
He wants to improve at this game.
He lives with his parents in a fairly remote location, and getting a tutor to physically show up at this location is not feasible.
