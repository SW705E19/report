\section{Class diagram}
A class diagram helps to create an understanding of the design of the system.
The following diagram illustrates the relevant classes related to the problem domain for the system.
It illustrates structural relations between classes and objects\cite{OOAD}.

\subsection{Users}
Users are defined through the \texttt{users} cluster.
A user aggregates 0 or more roles, which is a generalization of either the tutor or administrator classes.
The role class ensures that the user can have both of the different roles, only one role or neither role, and that it can be dynamically changed.
If a user does not have a role, the user is simply regarded as a user of the system - a person seeking a tutor.
Reports are used to ensure that the system is trustworthy and prevent the same problems recurring in interactions between students and tutors.
A user is associated with reports through an association relation.
They will be associated with 0 or more reports, depending on how many times the student has reported reported a tutor.
A report is associated with exactly 2 users, one being the student creating the report, and the other being the tutor to which the report is targeted.
Users are associated with 0 or more reviews in the same way, as students can rate their interactions with a tutor through a review.
If a review is created, it is associated with exactly 2 users as well, since both the tutor being reviewed and the student doing the review are necessary.

\subsection{Calendar}
The calendar is the part of the system through which students and tutors establish dates on which to meet.
One calendar is associated with one user.
A calendar aggregates 0 or more calendar events.
The calendar does not need an event, it can simply show the overall view of the month without any scheduled appointments.

\subsection{Messages}
Users can send messages through the system.
To facilitate this, users are associated with an inbox.
This inbox aggregates 0 or more of the user's messages.

\subsection{Reviews}
Reviews are made by students and are used to review the services of a tutor.
Since users make the reviews, they are associated with 0 or more reviews.
The user could have reviewed multiple services, or none at all.
The reviews are made for a particular service, meaning a service will be associated with 0 or more reviews, depending on whether or not any students have left any reviews for the service in question.

\subsection{Services}
A service is what the tutors provide through the system.
A user is associated with a service.
The user can be associated with 0 or more services, meaning that if the user is not a tutor they do not need to provide a service, and if they are a tutor they can provide more than one. 
In the same way, if the user is a student, they do not have to be associated with a service.
The service itself is associated with one or more users.
If the service exists, it may not necessarily be associated with any students, but it is always attributed to at least one tutor.
If the service only consists of material and is based around self studies, it could have multiple tutors authoring it, meaning it would be necessary to attribute the service to both.
A service aggregates 0 or more materials.
The tutor can choose to provide material for their service, as long as it is relevant.
However, a service could also simply be the tutor teaching the student in person, without material provided through the system.
Categories define the subject matter of a service, meaning a service is associated with one or more categories.
If a service is provided, it is based around a subject that defines its category.
However, the service might be related to more than just that one category.
The category assigned could be more specific to provide more information for the student, such as trigonometry rather than mathematics.
In such cases it would likely also be valuable to be able to assign multiple categories.
A category should also be able to exist without being associated to a service, meaning its multiplicity should be 0 to many.
