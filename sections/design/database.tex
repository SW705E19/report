\section{Database choice}
The application being developed doing this project is heavily focused on scalability, it is therefore important that a database system that can handle a lot of data and which makes scalability easier is chosen.
\\
Furthermore our application is going to handle a variety of data forms. It will store both structured data in the form of user profiles and posts as well as unstructured data such as pictures and videos.
\\
\\
This means that a relational and non-relational database system both could work, making the choice more difficult.
Since the team has more experience working with relational databases it was decided to go with this kind of system.
\\
The following list shows the database systems that were looked into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MySQL
    \item Oracle
    \item Postgres
    \item MariaDB
    \item Microsoft SQL Server  
\end{itemize}
