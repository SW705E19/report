\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}
In the following chapter we examine the design of this system.
To do so, we will design and describe prototypes for the system to be used when designing the front end.
A class diagram will be constructed to define the parts of the system, as well as an architecture diagram to define how the different components interact.
A choice of framework has to be made for the front end, and this will be described in this chapter, and an introduction to the chosen framework will be written.
We discuss the API design, and the structure of the database through an entity-relationship diagram.
Finally, we will take a look at the different methods for recommending items to users.
