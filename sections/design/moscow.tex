\section{MoSCoW}
In order to define the minimum viable product, the MoSCoW analysis model was used to prioritize the requirements in a way where the highest valued features are highlighted.
The MoSCoW analysis model consists of four levels of importance: Must have, should have, could have, and won't have at this time.

\subsubsection{Must have:}
The must-have features are essential for this project to work and are what can be defined as the minimum viable product for the system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A landing page that gives the user clear information about the purpose of the site
    \item It must be possible to create, read, update, and delete profiles as a tutor and a user
    \item Tutors and user can communicate through a messaging system
    \item A user can book a tutor
    \item Support of multiple languages
    \item A user must able to search for courses or tutors
    \item Must be GDPR compliant
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should have:}
These features are significant for the project but are not essential for it to work and be usable by the target demographic.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A tutor should be able to upload material and grant access to materials to certain users
    \item It should be possible to view materials
    \item A user should be able to rate and write reviews of a tutor's courses
    \item There should be an administration dashboard for administrators to delete or ban users and tutors
    \item A user should be able to see courses that he has participated in before
    \item Site should work on both mobile and web
    \item Each service must belong to one or more categories
    \item Testing for each component of the system
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could have:}
The could have features that are nice to have, but are less critical for the project.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A calendar page for a tutor to show available timeslots and booked times
    \item On-site payment service
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Won't have:}
The won't have features will enhance the quality of the project, but are deemed too large to implement for this semester project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item No requirements at the current time
\end{itemize}
