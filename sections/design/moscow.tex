\section{MoSCoW}
In order to define the minimum viable product, the MoSCoW analysis model was used to prioritize the requirements such that the highest valued features were highlighted.
The MoSCoW analysis model consists of four levels of importance: must have, should have, could have, and won't have at this time.

\subsubsection{Must have:}
The must have features are essential for this project to work and are what can be defined as the minimum viable product for the system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item It must be possible to create, read, update, and delete profiles as a tutor and a user
    \item See information about tutors
    \item Change a user to a tutor
    \item See all services
    \item See information about services
    \item Support of multiple languages
    \item A tutor must have information so a user can contact him
    \item There must be ratings for a tutor
    \item A user must able to search for courses or tutors
    \item Testing for each component of the system to ensure quality
    \item An intuitive user experience that has been systematically evaluated
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should have:}
These features are significant for the project but are not essential for it to work and be usable by the target demographic.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A landing page that gives the user clear information about the purpose of the site
    \item The site should work on both mobile and web
    \item Generate recommendations for users
    \item A user should only be able to rate a service once
    \item Each service should belong to one or more categories
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could have:}
The could have features are nice to have, but are less critical for the project.

\begin{itemize}
    \item There could be an administration dashboard for administrators to create new categories and ban users and tutors
    \item The possibility for a user to write a review of a tutor
    \item A calendar page for a tutor to show available timeslots and booked times
    \item A user can book a tutor
    \item On-site payment service
    \item Tutors and users can communicate through a messaging system
    \item A tutor could be able to upload material and grant access to materials to certain users
    \item It should be possible to view materials
    \item A user could be able to see courses that he has participated in before
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Won't have:}
The won't have features will enhance the quality of the project, but are deemed too large to implement for this semester project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item GDPR compliance
\end{itemize}
