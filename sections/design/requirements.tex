        \item Education
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non functional requirements}
These non functional requirements are more difficult to evaluate than the functional requirements.
Some of these requirements needs to be evaluated through a usability test. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Usability:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It needs to be intuitive
