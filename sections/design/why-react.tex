\section{Why React}
For our frontend, we decided to use React.
React is a JavaScript library for creating web applications\cite{ReactJS}. 
\\
React is one of the most popular choices when it comes to frontend development\cite{NPMVueReactAngular}.
It is created by Facebook and used for their website as well as numerous other websites\cite{ReactHistory}.
React is lightweight and allows the user to choose what additional libraries they would want to use in their project, which keeps its size down.
\\
It also has an extensive ecosystem that offers various solutions one could need in their web applications.
Being this popular results in a very robust ecosystem with lots of users, but this is also needed as the libraries are managed by the react community and is not a part of the core React library, unlike other frontend libraries\cite{Vue}.
\\\\
React was created so that it would be easier to make reusable UI components that can handle data that changes regularly\cite{ReactHistory}.
