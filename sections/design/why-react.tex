\section{Why React}
For our front end, we decided to use React.
React is a JavaScript library for creating web applications \cite{ReactJS}. 
\\
React is one of the most popular choices when it comes to front end development \cite{NPMVueReactAngular}.
It is created by Facebook and used for their website as well as numerous other websites \cite{ReactHistory}.
React is lightweight and allows the user to choose what additional libraries they would want to use in their project, which keeps the size of the project down.
\\
It also has an extensive ecosystem that offers various react specific libraries that one could use in their web applications.
Being this popular results in a very robust ecosystem with lots of users, but this is also needed as the additional libraries are maintained exclusively by the react community and are not a part of the core React library, unlike other front end libraries such as Vue \cite{Vue}.
\\
React was created so that it would be easier to make reusable UI components that can handle data that changes regularly \cite{ReactHistory}.
