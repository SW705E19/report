\section{Summary of the discussion chapter}
The process used for the project was satisfactory, but could be improved through a stricter system, in which retrospectives were conducted regularly and the developers met in person more often.
In terms of scalability, we conducted tests with vertical scaling, showing an improvement when cluter sizes increased.
For the scalability, we attempted to uphold the principles, but could have done better in terms of caching data and not tailoring the API to the front end.
The final design was mostly consistent with the prototypes, and based on the usability tests was fairly intuitive to use, with a few issues according to the test users.
In terms of the MoSCoW analysis we accomplished all must have and all should have requirements, creating the minimum viable product.
