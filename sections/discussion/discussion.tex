\chapter{Discussion}
In the following chapter we will discuss certain aspects of the system.
We do this in an attempt to reflect on these aspects, and determine how to improve, or whether or not we achieved what we wanted.
We will discuss our process while developing, evaluate the result in terms of our minimum viable product as defined through the MoSCoW model in \autoref{sec:moscow}, and determine what the system could benefit from in terms of future work.
