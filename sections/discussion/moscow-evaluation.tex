\section{MoSCoW evaluation}
Our MoSCoW was previously described in \autoref{sec:moscow}. 
This section is an evaluation of the requirements we have in the MoSCoW.

\subsection{Must have:}
Almost all \textit{must have} features have been completed.
These were considered absolutely essential to have a minimum viable product. 
The only \textit{must have} feature that we did not fully complete was testing for each component of the system to ensure quality.
We choose to focus test on the critical parts the API with most of the business logic. 
Some parts of the front end has been tested, but has been prioritized lower than the API, and therefore some parts of the front end is untested. 
The different tests and test methods have previously been described in \autoref{chap:testing-the-system}.
We did not have enough time to test everything as thoroughly as we wanted to.

\begin{table}[h]

\subsection{Should have:}
The \textit{should have} features improve the user experience a lot, but are not considered essential for the program.
All the should have features have been completed.

\todo{Check efter om A user should only be able to rate a service once. Er det fixet eller ej?}
\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|l|}
    \underline{Should have features:}                                                                 & \underline{Status} \\

   \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Could have:}
None of the requirements in \textit{could have} have been fully completed.
We have made an administration dashboard to create new categories, but administrators are still unable to ban users ban tutors.

\subsubsection{Won't have:}
We only had one feature in our \textit{won't have}. 
We did not consider GDPR compliance due to this being a semester project, and we do not plan on releasing the application.
