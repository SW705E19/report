\section{Reflections on our process}
In \autoref{sec:our-process} we described the process we used to organize our project workflow and how we incorporated parts of the scrum framework to better fit our project.
In this section, we reflect on our process and how it changed throughout the semester, as well as what we would change for our future projects.

\subsubsection{Scrum}
Our Scrum inspired process worked well with sprints, sprint planning, sprint backlog, product owner (PO), Scrum Master, planning poker, product backlog and product increment.
We took turns having the role as PO and Scrum Master.
The PO/Scrum Master had the task of planning the next product backlog and add a DoD (definition of done) onto every task in the product backlog.
This person also had the responsibility to send material to the supervisor, book a conference room and responsible for the planning poker.
The sprint backlog and product backlog can be seen on \autoref{fig:trello-kanban}. 
This is an kanban board on Trello we use to give an overview of how far people are with their tasks.
The leftmost column is the product backlog, the next four columns are the sprint backlog.
These are split into \textit{Sprint Backlog}, \textit{In progress}, \textit{In review} and \textit{Done}.

\noindent
When we conducted the sprint planning, we would use planning poker to estimate how many story points each task in the proposed sprint backlog should have.
The persons with the highest and lowest story points would discuss the reasoning behind it.
The story points were often very different if there were ambiguities, and people understood the tasks differently.
This gave everyone the same understanding on how the given tasks should be solved and eliminate most ambiguities. 
\\
However, in the middle of the project when we started to develop the application and learning \textit{React}, it started to become less systematic.
This was often due to it being difficult to estimate how long each task would take to solve.
When we got more familiar with \textit{React} we were able to estimate how much the tasks took, and it got more systematic again.
\\\\
We also stopped conducting the retrospective meetings.
The Scrum Masters stopped enforcing the retrospective meetings so they started fading out.
These meetings could have helped making the project more structured as we could have discussed the problems that we faced and the reasons why we did not complete our tasks in time.

\subsubsection{Formal reviews}
The formal reviews was something that we changed in the middle of the semester, so that two people had to review a pull request together.
Previously people would review a pull request individually.
Formal reviews were described in \autoref{sec:formal-reviews}.
The first part of every workday was spent on reviewing pull requests until all pull requests were reviewed.
\\\\
This increased the quality of the pull requests, as more errors were caught when two people had to debate the code.
This was especially important for big or difficult pull requests as it otherwise would be easy to just approve the pull request than to actually try and understand every part of it.
This is however more time consuming and more difficult to plan.
If two people are in process of reviewing a pull request another person can be waiting for them to finish if they are assigned a pull request with one of them. 
Then when a pull request had been reviewed and if changes are requested, then these people had to come back to review the changes.
To make this more organized a we created a PR spreadsheet to give an better overview of which pull requests you are assigned to, and who are currently requested to do many or few reviews.
This can be seen on \autoref{fig:formal-reviews}.

\subsubsection{Working from home}
Unlike other semesters, we were not assigned a group room this semester.
This resulted in us working from home most days in the week, because we thought this would be easier and as productive as if we met at the university.
One of the cons of working from home is that it is more difficult to get help from the other group members and this can lead people to get stuck on tasks.
After a few weeks we realized that it would be better if we had one workday together every week.
This was really beneficial as the more experienced React developers were able to help other members that were less experienced.
It was also easier to conduct a sprint planning when we met in person.

\subsubsection{Supervisor meetings}
The day before the supervisor meeting we sent the report, a reading guide and an agenda for the meeting.
Our supervisor gave feedback on the material that we sent to her and during the meeting we presented the things that we had done the previous week.
These meetings have been longer than the meetings we had previously experienced in last semesters, but this also resulted in better feedback, as the questions she asked made us reflect on certain choices we had made.

\subsubsection{What we would do differently}
One of the problems that we faced was that people could get stuck on tasks.
For future projects we would try to be more aware of where people are in the process, so that it would be easier to help them with solving their tasks.
One of the solutions to this could be daily standups, so that we are aware of where people are with their tasks, and which once they have not completed.

Another solution could be to have more workdays at the university, so that people have an easier time getting help from one another.
It is especially important in the beginning of the semester when there are still a lot of ambiguities and uncertainties with the project.  

We would also like to hold the retrospective meeting so that we had to reflect on the previous week and correcting the problems that we faced.

When adding tasks to the product backlog it should also be a requirement to add a DoD, as we multiple times were unable to recognize what needed to be done from just the title.
