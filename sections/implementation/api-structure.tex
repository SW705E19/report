\section{Structure of API}
This section will describe how how we have implemented and structured the API which is used as a link to the database.

\subsection{Controllers, middlewares, services and routes}
% Controllers, middlewares, services, routes
Something about how the API is split into controllers, middlewares, services and routes.
Talk a bit about each of them and why they are important.

The API is split into controllers so that endpoints that are related to the same entities are in the same controller. 
For example, the \texttt{authController} is responsible for endpoints such as logging in, registering a new user or changing a users password.



\subsection{API responses}
Something about HTTP responses and what to respond.
Maybe briefly mention REST?

\subsection{TypeORM}
With TypeORM we can define entity classes which corresponds to the tables we want to create in the database.
These entities are created as classes with attributes which we can put constraints on such as not allowing an attribute to be null. 
We can also define relationships between entities such as many-to-many and many-to-one.
Objects can be created using the entity classes. 
These objects can be saved to the database or extracted data can be assigned to the objects and then be returned in a HTTP response. 
Typeorm also provides repositories for each entity to allow for easy creation of queries to the database

Something about using TypeORM and why it is nice, so we do not have to make an ORM ourselves, or manually write the queries.

\subsection{Error handling}
Something about logging.
