\chapter{Implementation}
In the following chapter we will detail some of our implementation choices.
We will look at the structure of the API as well as the front end, and highlight some of the code to give an impression of the implementation.
The method of translation will be described along with its implementation.
Finally, we will discuss recommender systems, which choice of recommendation approach we chose, and how we implemented it.
