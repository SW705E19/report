\section{Summary of the implementation}
In this chapter we described how we strucured the system and implemented the functionality.
We implemented an API using TypeScript, NodeJS, TypeORM and express.
We implemented a front end using React, i18n for translation and Material UI.
Finally, we detailed our implementation of a recommender system based on collaborative filtering using a matrix factorization approach.
