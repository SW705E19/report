\section{Existing solutions}
There are many existing solutions for getting into contact with tutors and personal teachers.
Most of these existing solutions are like Mentor Denmark, but 
In this section we will only describe a few of them and those with the big differences.

\subsubsection{Mentor Denmark}
Mentor Denmark is the largest Scandinavian company for purchasing private teaching \cite{skandinaviens-stoeste-lektiefirma}.
There are multiple companies with similar business model, where you unite a personal teacher and student. 
Common to many of these companies is that you contact the company, where they will suggest a teacher to you.
Mentor Denmark has the teachers as employees, and are hereby responsible for the quality. 
They screen the applicants when applying for the job as a teacher, but also educates them. 
Hereby most people would expect a certain level for quality.
Most of these companies focus' on helping with homework in the primary school or high school.

\subsubsection{Menti}
Unlike Mentor Denmark, you contact the tutor directly instead of contacting the company to assign you a tutor.
Menti also allows tutors to teach in other subjects than the traditional once in public school and high school, such as teaching swimming or specific programming languages.
If you want to contact a tutor, you fill out an email form and then the tutor will contact you.
Typically the teaching will either be in person or on skype. 
To become a teacher on Menti, all you have to do is fill out a form and confirm the email.
When everyone can become a teacher, a lower level of quality is to be expected.

\subsubsection{Udemy}
Udemy is a very popular learning tool with around 100.000 online courses \cite{udemy}.
Unlike Menti and Mentor Denmark, this is not for personal teaching. 
You purchase access to a course with videos and possibly exercises and quizzes. 
You are able to see statistics such as how many people enrolled for the course, how many rated the course and the average rating for the course.
