\section{Our process}
The process for our group was inspired by scrum, and we used the following things from scrum:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprints 
    \item Sprint planning 
    \item Planning poker 
    \item Product owner 
    \item Sprint backlog 
    \item Product backlog   
    \item Product increment 
    \item Retrospectives 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We chose to have 1 week sprints, as they fit our supervisor meetings and we didn't have enough tasks for longer sprints.
Each week there would be a person assigned as the product owner role.
His role was to prepare the next weeks sprint and write a DoD (definition of done) on all tasks he chose to bring from the product backlog to the upcoming sprint backlog.
After each supervisor meeting we conducted a sprint planning where planning poker was used to estimate the workload of the tasks.
Each task in the sprint backlog would have a DoD and these would be discussed so that everyone had an agreement on how the task should be completed.
At the end of each sprint a product increment was held and before the next sprint planning a sprint retrospective was made to discuss the workflow of the previous sprint.
