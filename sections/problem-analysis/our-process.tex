\section{Our process}
The process for our group was inspired by scrum, and we used the following things from scrum:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprints 
    \item Sprint planning 
    \item Planning poker 
    \item Product owner 
    \item Sprint backlog 
    \item Product backlog   
    \item Product increment 
    \item Retrospectives 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We chose to have 1 week sprints, as they fit our supervisor meetings and we didn't have enough tasks for longer sprints.
We also experienced from last semester that shorter sprints were more productive as we had to communicate more and the tasks also had to be smaller and more well defined. 
Each week there would be a person assigned as the product owner role.
His role was to prepare the next weeks sprint and write a DoD (definition of done) on all tasks he chose to bring from the product backlog to the upcoming sprint backlog.
After each supervisor meeting we conducted a sprint planning where planning poker was used to estimate the workload of the tasks.
In the planning poker we also discussed the importance of the different tasks and which parts of a task was deemed insignificant and what should be focused on.
Each task in the sprint backlog would have a DoD and these would be discussed so that everyone had an agreement on how the task should be completed.
At the end of each sprint a product increment was held and before the next sprint planning a sprint retrospective was made to discuss the workflow of the previous sprint.
