\section{Scalability}



\subsection{What is scalability}
Scalability in software is the systems ability to handle an increasing amount of workload by expanding the system's resources. It is also important that the system does not need to be redesigned to maintain a good performance when the workload is increased.
\\\\
There are different types of scalability related to software design.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability in performance} 
    \item \textbf{Scalability in availability}
    \item \textbf{Scalability in maintenance}
    \item \textbf{Scalability in expenditure}
\end{itemize}
