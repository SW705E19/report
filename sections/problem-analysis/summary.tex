\section{Summary of the problem analysis}
In the preceding chapter we examined some existing solutions related to the problem of making accessible teaching services.
This revealed some differences in the ways tutors set their prices, and a correlation between the possibility to upload materials and receiving personal tutoring.
We defined a set of personas, which are fictive profiles of possible users, to help when constructing the design.
We determined some different types of scalability, and found some important principles to follow when making a system with scalability in mind, such as writing asynchronous code and building the API first.
Finally we defined our process, basing it around short, weekly sprints.
