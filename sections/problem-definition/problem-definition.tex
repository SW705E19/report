\chapter{Problem definition}
In \autoref{chap:introduction} we introduced an initial problem statement.
In this chapter we will examine the requirements of the system, construct a MoSCoW analysis of the requirements defining a minimum viable product, and finally update the problem statement to reflect what we deemed to be the minimum viable product.
