\section{Summary of testing}
In the preceding chapter we defined and discussed aspects of the project relating to testing.
We defined two types of tests, black-box, testing the system without access to the code, and white-box, where the tester knows the detail of how the software works.
Unit testing was our primary method of testing the system, and we used Mocha, Chai, Sinon and Nyc for these.
We focused on testing conditional rendering and business logic in the front end, and controllers and middleware in the back end.
Integration testing was used to test external libraries, but did not deem it as important as unit testing.
To ensure correctness of the tests and quality of the code, we used formal reviews.
We did this by pairing up when doing reviews and using a CI.
We researched mutation testing, but ultimately did not end up applying it.
To evaluate the design of the system we made use of usability testing.
