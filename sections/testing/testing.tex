\chapter{Testing the system}\label{chap:testing-the-system}
Testing the system is necessary to ensure quality.
In the following chapter we give an introduction to testing, and then describe and give examples of our approach to testing.
We will discuss unit testing, integration testing, formal reviews and mutation testing.
Finally we conduct a usability test of the system and examine the results.
