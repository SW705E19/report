}{% the abstract
Find a Tutor is a web service focused on connecting prospective learners and tutors through the internet.
The main focus for this report is to create a tested and scalable web solution.
It includes creating a set of personas for helping the design process, using the MoSCoW analysis model to define a minimum viable product and finally how the service is implemented using React for the frontend and NodeJS for the API.
Finally, we dive into different kinds of testing, and how vertical scaling affects the performance of the API.
